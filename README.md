meteor-sparkjs
==============

SparkJS for Meteor!

The idea of this package is to not only integrate the API with Meteor, but also to create some easy-to-use tools so any can create a web interface and actually worry about the Spark code.


## Isntallation

Just run the code:

```shell
$ meteor add ernestorocha:sparkjs
```

## Usage

Now you have a global object ``Spark`` on the server and now you can use the [oficial API](https://github.com/spark/sparkjs)
